export default `
  The \`Box\` component creates a React element with \`Flex\` and \`BasicBox\`
  styles reflected in its \`className\`.

  The default element created is \`div\` but this can be changed with the
  \`nodeType\` prop.

  You may pass props in addition to those defined below, such as
  \`aria-role='foo'\`, which will render the component
  with \`<div aria-role='foo' className='bar'>\` in the DOM.

  \`\`\`
  <Box p={3} m='b2' bg='white'>
    Hi, I am a box!
  </Box>
  \`\`\`
