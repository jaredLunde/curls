export default `
  The \`TextArea\` component creates a React element with \`Type\` styles
  reflected in its \`className\`.

  Styles are computed in the same order provided in \`props\`.

  You may pass props in addition to those defined below, such as
  \`placeholder='hello'\`, which will render the component
  with \`<textarea placeholder='hello' className='bar'>\` in the DOM.

  You may add your own placeholder, hover and focus classes by editing your
  theme with the \`getPlaceholderClass\`, \`getHoverClass\`, and
  \`getActiveClass\` functions defined. See the [default theme](#theme-example)
  below.
