export default `
  The \`Avatar\` component creates a React element with \`BasicBox\` styles. It
  is a "render prop" or "function as child" component but it comes with a
  default render function.

  Styles are computed in the same order provided in \`props\`.

  The default element created is \`span\` but this can be changed with the
  \`nodeType\` prop.

  This component contains a polyfill for \`object-fit\` to ensure the child
  \`img\` is properly oriented.
