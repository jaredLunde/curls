export default `
  The \`H3\` component creates a React element with special heading-specific
  styles and \`FlexBox\` styles reflected in its \`className\`.

  Styles are computed in the same order provided in \`props\`.

  The default element created is \`h3\`.

  You may pass props in addition to those defined below, such as
  \`aria-role='foo'\`, which will render the component
  with \`<h3 aria-role='foo' className='bar'>\` in the DOM.
