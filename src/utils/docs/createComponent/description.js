export default `
\`createComponent\` creates a "render prop" or "function as child" component which
will automatically create style classes with \`emotion.css()\`, apply a default theme
with \`ThemeConsumer\`, apply default props, and remove used props defined in
\`propTypes\` so they are not passed to the underlying child function.

See the [creating a component](/creating-a-component) page for a more detailed
example where I create an SVG-based \`Icon\` component from scratch.
