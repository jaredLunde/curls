export default `
  The \`Col\` component creates a React element with \`GridBox\` styles
  reflected in its \`className\`.

  Styles are computed in the same order provided in \`props\`.

  The default element created is \`div\` but this can be changed with the
  \`nodeType\` prop.

  You may pass props in addition to those defined below, such as
  \`aria-role='foo'\`, which will render the component
  with \`<div aria-role='foo' className='bar'>\` in the DOM.
