export default `
  The \`Divider\` component creates a React element with \`BasicBox\` styles.

  Styles are computed in the same order provided in \`props\`.

  The default element created is \`div\` but this can be changed with the
  \`nodeType\` prop.

  You may pass props in addition to those defined below, such as
  \`aria-role='separator'\`, which will render the component
  with \`<div aria-role='separator' className='bar'>\` in the DOM.
